# Wind-Energy-Potential-in-the-province-of-North-Holland
A study of Theoretical Energy Output from Wind Turbines

This was written in a group project for the course Spatial data analysis and simulation modelling AND aims to evaluate the theoretical energy output from wind turbines to determine suitable areas for investment in the North Holland province. In response to the ongoing global warming, renewable energy sources are in high demand, and wind energy is one of the most efficient options. Scholars focus on various aspects, such as geographical, technical, and economic potentials, to determine the best suitable location. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the suitable areas for wind turbines as well as evaluate the theoretical maximum energy production within these places.
