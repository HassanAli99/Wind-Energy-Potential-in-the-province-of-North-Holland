# Wind-Energy-Potential-in-the-province-of-North-Holland
A study of Theoretical Energy Output from Wind Turbines

This was produced as part of a group assignment for the course Spatial data analysis and simulation modeling AND seeks to analyze the theoretical energy output from wind turbines in order to identify viable investment regions in the North Holland province. Renewable energy sources are in increasing demand as a reaction to continued global warming, and wind energy is one of the most efficient possibilities. Researchers consider a variety of factors, including geographical, technological, and economic possibilities, to find the best acceptable location. As a result, the goal of this research is to identify acceptable regions for wind turbines and to assess the potential maximum energy output within these areas.
